##Features
- A circle animation expands and contracts to help visualize and focus on breathing.
- Gentle vibrations allow users to use the app even if they are not looking at the screen.
- The background colour, circle colour, and whether to enable vibrations are all selectable by the user.
- The duration of the breathing as shown on the main menu can be optionally set to be equal to the duration of the last breathing session. The number of breaths per minute can also be changed.
- The main screen displays how many minutes they have breathed using this app. It also displays the number of steps taken today, a greeting, or the user's current heart rate depending on their settings.
- A reminder can be set (every 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 hours) as a prompt to breathe. The time at which this begins can also be changed in the settings.
- Supports English, French, Spanish, and German (text in app, settings page all correspond to the watch's chosen language). Thanks to [noiob](https://github.com/noiob) for the German translation!
- App Glance to show how many minutes the user breathed in the last session.
